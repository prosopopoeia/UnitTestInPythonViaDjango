"Proxy for using W3C WebDriver compatible clients to interact with Gecko-based browsers.
This program provides the HTTP API described by the WebDriver protocol to communicate with Gecko 
browsers, such as Firefox. It translates calls into the Marionette remote protocol by acting as a 
proxy between the local- and remote ends."

-------------------I believe the above has Selenium:
Selenium is an umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries that enable and support the 
automation of web browsers.

It provides extensions to emulate user interaction with browsers, a distribution server for 
scaling browser allocation, and the infrastructure for implementations of the W3C WebDriver 
specification that lets you write interchangeable code for all major web browsers.
